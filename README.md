## Setting up the secret keys for payment testing

### Flutterwave

Follow these steps to test payments using Flutterwave's sandbox environment:

- Log in to your Flutterwave account and go to [Flutterwave Dashboard](https://dashboard.flutterwave.com)
- Toggle to **Test Mode** (top-right corner)
- Navigate to **Settings > API** to get your secret key
- Create a .env file in your backend directory and store the following:
  
```bash
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

- Replace 'your_secret_key' with your secret key

### PayPal

Follow these steps to test payments using PayPal's sandbox environment

- Log in to your PayPal account and go to [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/)
- Get both client ID and secret key from **Apps & Credentials** section
- Navigate to **Testing Tools > Sandbox Accounts**
- Create a personal account for testing
- Add the following to your backend .env file:

```bash
PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_sandbox_client_id
PAYPAL_SECRET=your_sandbox_secret
```

- Replace 'your_sandbox_client_id' with your client ID and 'your_sandbox_secret' with your secret key

---

## Setting up the Environment Variables

In backend, your .env file should look like this:

```bash
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_sandbox_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_sandbox_secret
PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox
REACT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

In frontend, your .env file should look like this:

```bash
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Running the Backend

Open a terminal on VSCode and follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jobigutenburg02/e-commerce-full-stack-app.git
```

### 2. Navigate into the backend folder

```bash
cd e-commerce-full-stack-app/backend
```

### 3. Create a virtual environment and activate it

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Apply migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Start the development server 

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 7. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

---

## Running the Frontend:

Open another terminal on VSCode and follow these steps:

### 1. Navigate into the frontend directory from the backend directory

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

Once both the backend and frontend are running, youâ€™ll be able to:
 - Browse products
 - Add items to cart
 - Log in/register
 - Place orders
